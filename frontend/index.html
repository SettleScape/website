			<h2>Support the Server!</h2>

			<p>The server costs over $20/month to host.  Everyone should chip in to help cover upkeep costs.  This is a small server, and it's the only way to keep it online.  Donors also get special cosmetic perks in-game, as a way of saying "thank you" to the people who keep us afloat.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Option #1:</strong>  <a href="https://GitHub.com/sponsors/SettleScape">GitHub</a> ($5/mo, 100% to SettleScape)</li>
				<li><strong>Option #2:</strong>  <a href="https://Patreon.com/SettleScape">Patreon</a> ($6/mo, 84% to SettleScape)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Alternatively, you can volunteer your labor -- Volunteers receive free donor status commensurate to their contributions.</p>

			<p><i>This is an unregistered non-profit.  Any surplus revenue will either be [1] invested in the server in the form of new plugins, etc;  [2] donated to the Open Source plugins we depend on;  or [3] distributed among SettleScape staff.</i></p>

			<p style="color: red;">At present, we are deeply in the red and desperate for funding.  Please, if you enjoy playing on this server, help split the costs of it.  One person does all of the development and administration for this project, and this one person is also paying for almost all of it.</p>
