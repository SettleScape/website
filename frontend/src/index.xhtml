				<h2>Support the Server!</h2>
				<p>The server needs about $30/month to cover its expenses.  Everyone should chip in to help cover upkeep costs.  This is a small server, and it's the only way to keep it online.  If you play on the server a lot, please contribute – don't freeload!</p>
				<p><i>This is an unregistered non-profit.  Any surplus revenue will either be [1] invested in the server in the form of new plugins, etc;  [2] donated to the Open Source plugins we depend on;  or [3] distributed among SettleScape staff.</i></p>
				<div>
					<p>Here are the paid plans we have available:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://GitHub.com/sponsors/SettleScape/sponsorships?tier_id=415601">Membership</a>&#32;<span>($8/mo)</span></li>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://GitHub.com/sponsors/SettleScape/sponsorships?tier_id=415600">Donorship</a>&#32;<span>($4+/mo)</span></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<span>
							Members get special perks in-game – our way of saying "thank you" to the people who keep us afloat.  If you can't afford a full membership, you are more than welcome to donate an amount less than the membership fee.
						</span>&#32;<span>
							Donors receive access to certain cosmetic perks that would normally require achieving a certain rank in-game.
						</span>&#32;<span>
							Alternatively, you can volunteer your labor – Volunteers receive free Donor or Member status commensurate to their contributions.
						</span>&#32;<span>
							And lastly, Boosters receive donor benefits in exchange for boosting the server on Discord.
						</span>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="attention">At present, we are deeply in the red and desperate for funding.  Please, if you enjoy playing on this server, help split the costs of it.  One person does all of the development and administration for this project, and this one person is also paying for almost all of it.</p>
